DISTRIBUTOR is not authorized to make warranties or          representations on behalf of PPG SHANGHAI and shall make no such          warranties or representations. THESE ARE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIONS OR          WARRANTIES THAT PPG SHANGHAI MAKES, AND ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED          WARRANTIES UNDER STATUTE OR ARISING OTHERWISE IN LAW FROM A COURSE OF          DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY          OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, ARE          DISCLAIMED BY PPG SHANGHAI. In the event that the Product fails to          conform to the warranties herein given, DISTRIBUTOR\\'s exclusive remedy          and PPG SHANGHAI\\'s sole responsibility is, at PPG SHANGHAI\\'s option,          limited to the replacement of such nonconforming Product at PPG          SHANGHAI\\'s expense or the refund of the purchase price attributable to          a specific delivery as to which a claim is made. For the avoidance of          doubt, PPG SHANGHAI hereby declares and represents that PPG SHANGHAI is          not responsible for any damage to the Products after they have been          taken away from PPG SHANGHAI\\'s warehouse and caused by DISTRIBUTOR or          its transport agent.\\n\\n11.2     It is PPG SHANGHAI\\'s responsibility to ensure that mis-delivery of          Product is kept to the minimum. DISTRIBUTOR shall inspect the Products          within 48 hours upon delivery. In case of discrepancy found in Products\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         delivered, DISTRIBUTOR shall report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing,          detailing all the discrepancies within 48 hours after delivery. PPG          SHANGHAI will not accept any claims for discrepancy in delivery beyond          the 48 hours period. If Products are found damaged upon delivery,          DISTRIBUTOR or its customers who directly receive the delivery shall          report to PPG SHANGHAI in writing within 48 hours. The necessary and          sufficient evidence (and photos) required for insurance claim must be          submitted altogether.

FORCE MAJEURE\\n\\nPPG SHANGHAI\\'s failure or inability to make, or DISTRIBUTOR\\'s failure or inability to take, any delivery or deliveries when due, or the failure or inability of either party to effect timely performance of any other obligation required of it hereunder, if caused by \"force majeure\" as hereinafter defined, shall not constitute a default hereunder or subject the party affected by force majeure to any liability to the other; provided, however, that the party so affected shall promptly notify the other of the existence thereof and of its expected duration and the estimated effect thereof upon its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Such party shall promptly notify the other party when such force majeure circumstance has ceased to affect its ability to perform its obligations hereunder. The quantity to be delivered hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of the deliveries omitted for such cause or causes, unless both parties agree that the total quantity to be delivered hereunder shall remain unchanged. For so long as its ability to perform hereunder is affected by such force majeure circumstance, PPG SHANGHAI may, at its option, elect to allocate its total production of Product among its various requirements therefor (e.g., manufacturing and sales) in such manner as PPG SHANGHAI deems practicable and which, in the opinion of PPG SHANGHAI, is fair and reasonable. During the time that PPG SHANGHAI is unable to make deliveries or otherwise perform, it shall not be obligated to procure, or to use its best efforts to procure, any quantity of Product sold hereunder from any alternate producer or supplier. As used herein, the term \"force majeure\" shall mean and include any act of God, nature or the public enemy, accident, explosion, operation malfunction or interruption, fire, storm, earthquake, flood, drought, perils of the sea, strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, riots, sabotage, embargo, war (whether or not declared and whether or not the United States of America is a participant), federal, state or municipal legal restriction or limitation or compliance therewith, inability to obtain export licenses, failure or delay of transportation, shortage of, or inability to obtain, raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel, power, labor, or other operational necessity, interruption, or curtailment of power supply, or any other circumstance of a similar or different nature beyond the reasonable control of the party affected thereby. In this connection, a party shall not be required to resolve labor disputes or disputes with suppliers of raw materials, supplies, equipment, fuel or power, except in accordance with such party\\'s business judgment as to its best interest.\\n\\n13.      PRODUCT HANDLING\\n\\nDISTRIBUTOR acknowledges that it has experience and expertise in handling and storing the Products, and that DISTRIBUTOR has the obligation to handle, store and distribute the Products safely and properly.\\n\\n14.      PRODUCT SAFETY\\n\\nPPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR recognize the importance of product safety considerations and the need to protect persons and property against unsafe conditions that could occur from the improper use, transportation, storage, handling, distribution or disposal of the Products sold hereunder. PPG SHANGHAI and DISTRIBUTOR will follow PPG\\'s Responsible Care(R) Distributor Guidelines as set forth in the attached Appendix I (Responsible Care(R) is a registered trademark in the United States of the American Chemistry Council ).
